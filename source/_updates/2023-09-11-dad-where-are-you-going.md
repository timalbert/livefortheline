<h2>It was still dark out at 5:30 a.m.</h2>

I was able to avoid the creaks and cracks of the floor tiptoeing past the boys bedroom as I snuck out of the house for my treatment. I thought I had made my escape as I headed downstairs, but a soft, concerned voice whispered, "Dad, where are you going?" Surprised that Caleb was awake, I considered how to respond.

Do I tell a little fib? “I’m going out for a jog” (unlikely). Or, “I’m getting an early start on breakfast and your lunches” (unusual). Or the truth that daily breaks my heart? I’m going to get life or death treatment. I’m going to stare cancer in the face. I’m going to find out how long I have to live.

<h2>How do you discuss a cancer diagnosis with your kids?</h2>

How do you handle a fragile child’s heart that believes his dad is strong, not weak. Healthy, not sick. The family provider, not the one in need. I’m weary holding his childlike concern and decide to punt for another day. I replied, “Buddy, dad has a doctor's appointment this morning. Go back to bed and don’t wake up mom or your brothers.”

Needless to say, I don't have a great answer. Over the last two years, I’ve learned a lot through the help of social workers and <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2022/3/3/22956353/fatherhood-cancer-jonathan-tjarks" class="text-yellow-500">others who have walked this path</a>. Rarely, though, has anyone touched my deep heart wounds.

The Psalms, however, have taught me how to grieve and lament life's unanswerable questions. I often make Psalm 77’s sincere words my own in the dark of night.

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="https://www.esv.org/Psalm+77:1-3/" caption="Psalm 77:1-3">
    <div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">1.</span> I cry aloud to God,</div>
        <div class="ml-6">aloud to God, and he will hear me.</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">2.</span> In the day of my trouble I seek the Lord;
        <div class="ml-6">In the night my hand is stretched out without wearying;</div>
        <div class="ml-6">my soul refuses to be comforted.</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">3.</span> When I remember God, I moan;</div>
        <div class="ml-6">when I meditate, my spirit faints.</div>
    </div>
</x-blockquote>

My son’s innocent question strikes at the core of my fears. He doesn't know all that he’s stirred in my soul. I spend a significant portion of each day replaying what seems inevitable in my mind: life cut short and my boys growing up without their father.

<h2>God can handle the disappointment</h2>

Like Psalm 77:3-4, I often cry out, at times  even reach out, and wonder if God is there and listening. I appreciate the honesty of these verses and adopt the prayerful heartache, “my  soul <i>refuses to be comforted</i> … I <i>moan</i> and my <i>spirit faints</i>.”

As my boys understand more, anxiety sets in and turns my “day to trouble.” It’s hard, but I find a peculiar comfort that God’s word speaks with a lament, rather than counsel someone in despair would prefer not to hear. The Psalms have been a wise counselor.

The night before a recent MRI, my oldest son Caleb caught me reading my bible on my knees. It just happened to be Psalm 77. He asked me why I seemed sad. Candidly, I told him I was talking to God about my doctor’s appointment in the morning. With great fear he asked, “are you going to get a shot?” He knows from experience how miserable that can be. I told him that I would have to get a shot, but that wasn’t what I was most scared about.

I asked if I could show him a portion of Psalm 77. I've found it offers practical wisdom when I don’t understand what God is doing am afraid.

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="https://www.esv.org/Psalm+77:10-20/" caption="Psalm 77:10-20">
    <div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">10.</span> Then I said, “I will appeal to this,</div>
            <div class="ml-6">to the years of the right hand of the Most High.”</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">11.</span>  I will remember the deeds of the LORD;</div>
            <div class="ml-6">yes, I will remember your wonders of old.</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">12.</span>  I will ponder all your work,</div>
            <div class="ml-6">and meditate on your mighty deeds.</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">13.</span>  Your way, O God, is holy.</div>
            <div class="ml-6">What god is great like our God?</div>
       <div> …</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">19.</span>  Your way was through the sea,</div>
            <div class="ml-6">your path through the great waters;</div>

        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">20.</span>  You led your people like a flock</div>

As the boys start to comprehend my cancer diagnosis, my hope is they will grow in trusting God’s faithfulness,  even when his way leads through the sea of suffering and his “footprints are unseen.” I pray they know <a href="https://youtu.be/Lq1kJLN-izE?si=3tnTPOA8oHSFbQ2M" class="text-yellow-500">Jesus</a> hears their cry and his hand is reaching out to lead them through life.

When evil appeared to win at the cross, even Jesus cried out using the Psalms (Psalm 22:1). God used his suffering to turn the darkest evil into the greatest imaginable good for those who look upon him (John 3:14-15).

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="https://www.esv.org/Psalm+Romans+8:18/" caption="Psalm Romans 8:18">
    <div>I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.</div>
