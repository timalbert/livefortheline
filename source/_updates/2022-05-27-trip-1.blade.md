Wir haben es nach TÃ¼bingen, Deutschland geschafft!

Good friends accompanied us for the duration of this first trip. After a fun pit stop in London, we wished the queen a happy jubilee and arrived safely at our destination: Tubingen, Germany. 

I received the induction phase of my vaccine, which was 4 doses over the course of 4 consecutive days. Each dose consists of 4 painful, subcutaneous (the fatty tissues just beneath the skin) shots in my stomach (Lots of 4's ðŸ˜‰).

Overall, my first trip has been smooth and without complications.

Please pray that this will be the case throughout my treatment. Lord willing, I will make this trip once per month 10 more times.

Vielen Dank,<br>
Tim and Kate
