Back in Germany for trip #2 and dose #5. This time, my travel companion is my cousin and best friend, Jim. We came through London and stumbled upon a small tennis tournament down the street from Heathrow airport. 

Psalm 90 has been an anchor for this trip, and for my soul this year. Faced with the brevity of life through this cancer and just recently losing a dear aunt and uncle, I've longed for something that doesn't fade away in life. 

The Lord who is eternal and unchanging — "from everlasting to everlasting" (v. 2) — has been that comfort for me and I know whatever's facing you, he can be that too.

"Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days" (v. 14).
