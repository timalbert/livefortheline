Tragedy has always been at a comfortable distance away in my life. Amidst the pandemic in 2020, my eyes were opened when a friend my age was diagnosed with ALS and a hero of mine  <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.challies.com/articles/my-son-my-dear-son-has-gone-to-be-with-the-lord/">lost his 20 year old son</a> . Suddenly, I found myself able to envision how suffering might come for me too.

Theologically, I saw the trials and afflictions others faced as a shadow of what will come sooner or later, but only from the perspective as a comfortable onlooker. I knew I wasn’t immune to the realities of a fallen world. Jesus said so in John 16:33, “I have said these things to you, that in me you may have peace. <b b class="font-semibold">In the world you will have tribulation</b>. But take heart; I have overcome the world.”

Would the low grade, everyday hardships be my only irritations in life? At 35, I was not afflicted by suffering in a personal way. I was busy being a 35 year old with a wife, 3 young boys , and a new promotion. I have a full life to live, a family to raise, a God to serve!

## My own tragedy struck

Then, a tidal wave of suffering came straight at me. After an abrupt, traumatic surgery, I was told unimaginable news. I had brain cancer and there is no known cure. My life would likely be painful and shortened by this terrible disease. There isn't even a category of remission for this diagnosis. 

Will anything ever be the same again? What will happen to my family? Where can I turn? Questions only mounted and fears of the future quickly set in. The perception others had of a man with “strong faith” started to look a lot more like flimsy self-reliance.

In the early months after my diagnosis, I spent a long while reading through the Christian hope in the resurrection of The Lord Jesus Christ. The final chapters of 1 Corinthians and the beginning of 2 Corinthians were worn, tear-covered pages in my bible. A familiar verse I’ve tended to gloss over shined bright in the darkest moment of my life. 

<x-blockquote class="font-mono">
    <div>Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead. (2 Corinthians 1:9)</div>
</x-blockquote>

Living with a terminal diagnosis has felt, at times, like I've been given a death sentence. I’m not headed to the gallows, but the end has been pronounced, my outcome as sure as the best doctors can determine. 

Comforts are hard to come by and when they do, they sift through my fingers like sand. I look at my boys and long to be present throughout their lives. This season truly revealed just how much I “rely on myself.” Can all my dreams and desires be swept away through this storm?

## What is your hope?

despondency presses in during moments like this asking, what hope is there to escape inevitable death? 

The cure I longed to hear about from my doctors, I heard afresh through the scriptures. Sitting on my in-laws' guest bed, I silently raised my hands in praise. It was the word I needed to hear. A reminder of the hope I cling to even when all else is lost. Jesus is the one who, by his wounds, heals our sentence of death (Isaiah 53:5). 

<a href="https://www.crossway.org/books/gods-grace-in-your-suffering-tpb/" class="text-yellow-500">David Powilson writes</a>, “Whatever you must face changes in the light of the resurrection of Jesus Christ and the promise that you, too, will live.”

Be still my soul and trust in the “eternal rock” (Isaiah 26:4). A life built on Jesus (Matthew 7:24-27) can withstand the raging floods that will come in this life. Take it to heart, God will do nothing less than raise you from the dead!
