In early March, our family of 5 traveled to Orlando for a much needed getaway. <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://inheritanceofhope.org/">Inheritance of Hope</a>, an organization that cares for families facing the loss of a parent, sent us on their signature program, <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://inheritanceofhope.org/retreats">the legacy retreat</a>. It‚Äôs a time designed to create a memorable experience for families with young children in our circumstance.

With more than 45 others, we enjoyed fun-filled days at Disney World and Universal Studios. IOH provided two full-time volunteers to assist with our kids. Luke and Natalie were on a mission to ensure we had a blast! Three additional volunteers from the lead sponsor, <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.kendrascott.com/philanthropy.html">Kendra Scott</a>, joined us as well. They were thoughtful and kind, helping us navigate the weekend and constantly spoiled üòÉ our boys. This team left an indelible mark of love on us and labored to provide a once-in-a-lifetime experience we would never pursue on our own.

I had heard of the thought and care IOH puts into these retreats, but the experience surpassed our expectations! Hopefully it‚Äôs conveyed through some of the pictures!

The weekend was more than fun at amusement parks. We were welcomed with a dinner party, pampered through a night out with other parents, and encouraged during intentional sessions alongside families to process our experiences.

It was comforting to share vulnerably with others who have walked in our shoes. I was crushed by the suffering so many face, yet encouraged by their resilience and camaraderie.

A recurring topic among those of us facing terminal illness, was how discouragement comes from multiple angles. From recurrence setbacks, treatment side-effects, struggles with insurance coverage and finances, to absorbing well-intentioned, but not-so-helpful comments people tend to make. One sharp remark made me laugh‚Äîwith slightly morbid agreement‚Äî when someone shared ‚ÄúI tell people who remind me that we all can all get hit by a bus tomorrow, that the bus üöç doesn‚Äôt follow them around everywhere they go!‚Äù There was a lot of laughter and head nods. It felt like the room could go on endlessly sharing similar versions too.

Personally, there have been occasions where I‚Äôve struggled with comments too. Over time, I‚Äôm coming to more readily empathize with those who don‚Äôt have the perfect words or any words to say. Grief ripples out from those who face cancer and death. There are no rote words to offer sufferers. No playbook to run. Often the best moments are when someone tells us they love us with a hug.

I‚Äôve found myself more reliant on God‚Äôs word to express my own thoughts, emotions, and needs. Nancy Guthrie‚Äôs book <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.nancyguthrie.com/im-praying-for-you">I‚Äôm Praying For You</a> has been a helpful resource. It summarizes 40 prayers from the Bible for those facing suffering. She is a <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/discussion-with-nancy-guthrie">seasoned and trusted counselor</a> on the subject.

<h2>Managing Change</h2>

The disturbance of sudden change has inverted our life over the last two years. It's been a lot to manage as there's been some crushing lows and unexpected highs. The sudden changes to our life have been a cocktail mixed with cutting losses and a splash to the face with refreshed hope. Life is no longer what it was. Accepting that reality has been, and will be, a lifelong road to travel.

Many have described <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.desiringgod.org/messages/the-purposes-of-god-in-the-pain-of-the-world">God's purposes in our suffering and trials</a>. The last two years have held up the mirror of my limits and mortality. The dissatisfied longing for something beyond this world has rung loud and clear.

Familiar <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.crossway.org/books/songs-of-suffering-dl/">psalms and hymns</a> have helped complete this broken melody humming in the background of my life. For me, "It Is Well" captures the sorrows of loss and the highs of hope that resolve in the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ.

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" caption="Horatio G. Spafford, 1873" cite="https://youtu.be/rhaTIu_k4w0">
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;<br>
<b>Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,<br>
It is well, it is well, with my soul.</b>

It is well, with my soul,<br>
It is well, with my soul,<br>
It is well, it is well, with my soul.<br>
<br>
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,<br>
Let this blest assurance control,<br>
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,<br>
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.<br>

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!<br>
My sin, not in part but the whole,<br>
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,<br>
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!<br>

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:<br>
If dark hours about me shall roll,<br>
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life<br>
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.<br>

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,<br>
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;<br>
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,<br>
Even so, it is well with my soul.
