In early March, our family of 5 traveled to Orlando Florida for a much needed weekend getaway. <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://inheritanceofhope.org/">Inheritance of Hope</a>, an organization that supports families facing the loss of a parent, blessed us tremendously through their signature program, <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://inheritanceofhope.org/retreats">the legacy retreat</a>. It’s a time designed to create a memorable experience for families with young children in our circumstance.

With more than 45 others, we enjoyed fun-filled days at Disney World and Universal Studios. IOH provides 2 full-time volunteers to assist with kids. They were on a successful mission to ensure we had a blast!  3 additional volunteers from the lead sponsor, Kendra Scott, joined us as well. They were thoughtful and kind, helping us navigate the weekend and kept spoiling 😃 our boys. This team left an indelible mark of love on us and labored to provide a once-in-a-lifetime experience we would have never pursued on our own.

I could go on about the thought and care IOH put into this weekend. Hopefully it’s seen through some of the pictures! The retreat was so much more than fun days at the amusement parks. We were able to participate in private sessions with other families to process all we’ve experienced.

It felt comfortable expressing and relating to others as we vulnerably shared our journeys. I was crushed by the suffering so many face, yet encouraged by the resilience and camaraderie we collectively shared.

A recurring topic among those of us facing terminal illness, was how discouragement comes from multiple angles. From recurrence setbacks, treatment side-effects, struggles with insurance coverage, to absorbing well-intentioned, but not-so-helpful comments people tend to make. One sharp remark made me laugh—with slightly morbid agreement— when someone shared “I tell people who remind me that we all can all get hit by a bus tomorrow, that the bus doesn’t follow them around everywhere they go!” There was a lot of laughter and head nods. It felt like the room could go on endlessly sharing their version too.

Personally, there have been occasions where I’ve struggled to absorb the comments too. Over time, I’m coming to more readily empathize with those who don’t have the perfect words or any words to say - it’s okay. Grief ripples out from those who face cancer and death. There are no rote words to offer sufferers. No playbook to run.

I’ve found myself more reliant on God’s word to express my own thoughts, feelings, and needs. Nancy Guthrie’s book, <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.nancyguthrie.com/im-praying-for-you">I’m Praying For You</a>, is my go-to lately. It summarizes 40 biblical prayers for those facing suffering. She is a <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.desiringgod.org/interviews/discussion-with-nancy-guthrie">seasoned and trusted counselor</a> on the subject.

If I had one word to sum up the last 2 years, turbulent would be my choice. I’ve had some crushing lows and surprising highs. It’s been a cocktail mixed with cutting losses and a splash to the face with refreshed hope. Life is no longer what it was. Accepting that reality has been, and will be, a lifelong road to travel.

Many have described well that God has purposes in our suffering and trails. They hold up the mirror of my limits and mortality. The dissatisfied longing for something beyond this world has rung loud and clear.

Familiar <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.crossway.org/books/songs-of-suffering-dl/">psalms and hymns</a> have helped complete the broken melody humming in the background of my life. For me, "It Is Well" captures the sorrows of loss and the highs of hope that resolves in the resurrected Lord Jesus Christ.

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" caption="Horatio G. Spafford, 1873">
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;<br>
<i>Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.</i>

It is well, with my soul,
It is well, with my soul,
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
My sin, not in part but the whole,
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live:
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But, Lord, ‘tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!
Blessèd hope, blessèd rest of my soul!

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll;
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
Even so, it is well with my soul.
