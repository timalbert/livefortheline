Flying home from another successful trip to Germany. This time, my sister, Kristen, came along for the journey. We accelerated my routine consolidating our travel to 3 days and 2 nights. Overall, it was quick and manageable. We had a few near missteps ðŸ™ƒ but I'll be a pro next month.

It was great fun and a rare treat to spend these few days together, mixing life-giving conversations and exploring the center of Tubingen. We even got a few light jogs to the terminal in.

The team at the clinic administered does 7. This is a milestone for my immune response. I'll get results back in about 8 weeks. We've been praying for off-the-charts T-cell response to the peptide vaccine I've been receiving. If things go as expected, my travel could ease to ever other month in the future.

Would you pray for this immune response and my continued treatment?
