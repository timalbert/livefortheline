Flying home from another successful trip to Germany. This time, my sister, Kristen, came along for the journey. We accelerated my travel routine, consolidating to 3 days and 2 nights. Overall, it was quick and manageable. We had a few near missteps ðŸ™ƒ but I'll be a pro next month.

It was a rare treat and great fun to spend these few days together, mixing in our exploration of Tubingen with life giving conversations and a few jogs to our terminal.

The team at the clinic administered does 7. This is a milestone for the immune testing. I anticipate receiving results in about 8 weeks. Weâ€™ve been praying for an off-the-charts T-cell response to the peptide vaccine. If things go as expected, my travel could ease in the future to every other month. 

Would you please continue to pray for my treatment?
