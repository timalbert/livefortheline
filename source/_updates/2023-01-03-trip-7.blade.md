Happy new year! I hope you enjoyed a wonderful Christmas season. With great joy, we celebrated alongside family and our church.

In the last week of the year, by God’s grace, I received reassuring news after my MRI that it appeared unchanged and stable.

Trip 7 had me flying overnight on New Year’s Day. My good friend Thaddeus met me in London and he accompanied me to Germany for dose 10 of treatment. As more unfolds regarding these personalized cancer vaccines, I’m thankful by the providential timing in my journey. Please pray for CeGat, Dana Farber and others working towards approval for this type of treatment.

I’m grateful to God that the team thought it best to return every 3 months for now. It will be a nice break from monthly international travel until April. An additional immune test was drawn and I’m praying it reveals a progressively stronger t-cell response.

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="https://www.esv.org/Ephesians+3:20-21/" caption="Ephesians 3:20-21">
    <div>Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.</div>
</x-blockquote>

We reflected on the great doxology in Ephesians 3 this trip. I am moved to a deeper reliance in God’s ability to work towards what he intends. When I’m lost for words - even better, when I can hardly focus enough to think clearly, God is not limited by my weakness, he is able! My trust is in his ability to achieve his good and perfect will.

        “Thou art coming to a King, large petitions with thee bring, for His grace and power are such none can ever ask too much.”
    </div>
</x-blockquote>

You have been a tremendous support and encouragement to us this past year. I thank God for you regularly (Philippians 1:3).

I wish you all the best and hope to connect in some meaningful ways this year! Please don’t hesitate to reach out!
