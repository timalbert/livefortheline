Over the last 12 weeks, my oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute has been monitoring an enhancement that has continued to progress for 3 consecutive MRI's. At my latest appointment (10/4) the team recommended I undergo another craniotomy to remove a lesion and biopsy to determine what is growing - believing it likely contains new tumor. I'll have this procedure next Friday 10/27. Thankfully, it will be with the same neurosurgeon at MGH. She performed my first in February 2021 with great success.  The goal is to remove as many unhealthy cells as possible, complement with targeted radiation and return to my maintenance immunotherapy routine in Germany post recovery.

Earlier in October, my wife Kate underwent back surgery on 2 herniated discs. For most of the summer, she endured extreme back and leg pain making it difficult to sit upright, drive, and lift our boys. The procedure has proven successful as Kate has made great progress towards a full recovery. Still, we will likely overlap with some major limitations next month including lifting and driving restrictions, along with the daily challenge of managing our 3 young, energetic boys.

In addition to praying for a successful and full resection through my surgery, would you pray for us as we navigate the uncertainties and trials before us. By God’s grace we had a friend feel compelled to provide live-in help for the next 4-6 weeks!

I have felt prepared to walk this road after a season of reflecting on ​Psalm 77​. The week before my MRI, I posted a reflection I’d have a hard time getting out now:

<p class="text-center font-bold"><a href="https://www.livefortheline.com/updates/dad-where-are-you-going/">​Dad, Where Are You Going?</a></p>

It was good for my heart to lament the depths of that childlike question. Pray for us to show patient compassion and understanding as we approach these discussions about surgery and cancer with our boys. Specifically, that they would know their heavenly Father in a deep and profound way as they witness the frailty of their earthly dad through surgery and recovery.

<h2>PMC Kids Ride!</h2>

This fall, we participated in the <a href="https://kids.pmc.org">PMC Kids Ride</a> in Westwood, MA put on by world-class volunteers. We had a great crew, made some new friends and plenty of lasting memories!

<h2>Unexpected Kinship</h2>

While I worked at Northeastern, I never expected that time could help prepare for this season. Going on disability has been humbling, but after working for 10 years and growing in my career, I walked away with tremendous friendships and support. Perhaps, the most unlikely Ruthann. We sat across from one another for 5 years, eventually connecting through our shared faith. Recently, she’s accompanied me at appointments as a seasoned patient navigator. Come to find out, her family has poured their life into pushing back the darkness of brain cancer - from Dana-Farber’s inception no less! What’s a providential grace
