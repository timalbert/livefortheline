Dear brothers and sisters in Christ at the Ukrainian Pentecostal church in Philadelphia.

This thank you is a far too late, but I hope it finds you well after the Christmas season and at the start of the 2023 year of our Lord.

I’ve been deeply humbled, that you would take up such a generous offering for me and my family. God has shown me again and again that he owns a “cattle on a thousand hills” (Psalm 50:10) and will always provide according to his good and perfect will.

As I’ve been learning to love the Psalms in this season, one in particular that's been near to me is Psalm 84. It’s a pilgrimage Psalm where the people of God head for worship in Jerusalem. Whever they are coming from, they travel through a valley (v. 6). In their joy for where they are headed, even the valley becomes a place of springs (v. 6b).

God's used you to lift my head and trust more deeply in Christ. That he is sovereign over my journey through cancer, a "sun and shield" (v. 11).

Much love, grace and peace to you!
- Tim and Kate, Caleb, Nathan & Matthew
