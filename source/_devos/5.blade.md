The Information Age in which we live pushes us quickly along to the next thing. The next headline, article, video or tweet. I find it hard to linger, even over important matters. 

When my anxieties are pressed, like today while waiting on medical results, I find myself prone to let the attention economy just take my mind for a “scroll.”

I’ve loved W. Robert Godfrey’s teaching series <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://connect.ligonier.org/library/learning-to-love-the-psalms-26981/59193/path/">Learning To Love The Psalms</a> and decided to go down that path instead. In the introduction he makes the point that we must slow down in order to properly read and appreciate the Psalms. 

He helped me linger over <b class="px-2 bg-yellow-400 text-slate-800 font-semibold inline-block text-base rounded">surely</b>. What a wonderful word, he quotes from a John Updike poem. 

What am a sure of today? Tomorrow? Next year? Disappointed, waiting for results, it was good to think on what is sure that, <span class="text-blue-300">"goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house of the LORD forever.</span>"

Praise God.
