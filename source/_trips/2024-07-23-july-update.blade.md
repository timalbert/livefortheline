The last few months have been fast-paced and  full of highs and lows for our family. As we transitioned into summer-mode.  Our 3 young boys are mostly at home. I traveled to London to receive the 4th and 5th doses of a Dendritic-cell vaccine in London. I returned home to a disappointing MRI which revealed tumor progression.

While the scope of my treatment takes shape, the next steps are clear: I will start another cycle of chemotherapy coupled with an inhibitor to get the regrowth under control, Lord Willing.

Grief and discouragement has knocked us sideways earlier than expected, but the good shepherd has been near as we continue to trust in his protection and care. It feels counterintuitive to say God is good in this season's trials when, by pathogen or assassin, we have renewed tastebuds for heaven being reminded how fragile and fleeting this life and world can be. The Lord has been nothing but good and merciful in our time of need (Hebrews 4:16).

Grace and peace to you,
<br>Tim
