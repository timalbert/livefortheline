Back in Germany for trip 2 and dose 5. This time, my travel companion is my cousin and best friend, Jim. We came through London and stumbled our way in to a small tennis ðŸŽ¾ tournament.

Psalm 90 has been an anchor for this trip, and for my soul this year. Faced with the brevity of life through my cancer and just recently, losing a dear aunt and uncle, I've longed for something that doesn't fade away in life.

The Lord who is eternal and unchanging â€” "from everlasting to everlasting" (v. 2) â€” has been that comfort for me and I know whatever's facing you, he can be that too.

"Satisfy us in the morning with your steadfast love, that we may rejoice and be glad all our days" (v. 14).
