Dear Family and Friends,

Thank you again for walking with us.

Tim has transitioned to a 24/7 hospice care home in Wayland, MA. The staff has been outstanding, providing both excellent support and dignity in this season. True to form, Tim continues to bring levity to every room—his quick wit and humor are fully intact, and he’s still making us laugh.

Last week, Josh and the team from Charles River Church brought church to Tim. We shared worship, communion, a homily, and meaningful time together. It was deep, joyful, and one of those moments you don’t forget.

A verse that continues to anchor Tim is Psalm 146:2:

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="https://www.esv.org/Psalm+146:2/" caption="Psalm 146:2">
    <div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">2.</span> I will praise the Lord all my life;</div>
        <div class="ml-6">I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</div>
    </div>
</x-blockquote>

In this season, Tim has reflected that God is helping him see more clearly: life was never meant to be lived for ourselves alone. He’s been drawn deeper into the truth that we are made to live for God’s glory—and with eternity in view.

It’s an honor and a privilege to witness.
