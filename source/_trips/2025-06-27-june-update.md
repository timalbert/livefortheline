It is with a heavy heart that I share that God has taken Tim home to Heaven. Please see his obituary below:

Timothy Mark Albert, known to most as “Tim”, passed away peacefully on June 26, 2025, at the age of 39, surrounded by those he loved most. He bravely fought a four-year battle with brain cancer, inspiring many through his unwavering faith, courage, and deep compassion.

Tim was born on February 10, 1986, to Denis and Theresa (Fairweather) Albert, and grew up with his sister, Kristen (Albert) Morin. From an early age, he showed a deep love for life and an extraordinary athletic ability—excelling in baseball, basketball, and football. 

He graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a degree in Recreation Management and Policy with a minor in Information Systems. Tim went on to build a meaningful career as a web developer. At Northeastern University, Tim led a digital team that helped shape an outstanding online experience for students and faculty alike.

Tim had a heart for inner-city ministry and spent years working with incarcerated youth, sharing God’s love and the hope of redemption. He was deeply involved in nonprofit and charitable work, offering his skills in website design, social media, and digital outreach to causes like the Beach Bike Ride and more. Tim also founded Live For The Line, a ministry platform created to encourage those facing cancer to rely on God for strength, peace, and even joy in the battle.

Above all, Tim was a devoted husband and father. He leaves behind his beloved wife of 10 years, Kate (Lawlor) Albert, and their three adoring young sons: Caleb (9), Nathan (7), and Matthew (4). Tim is also survived by his parents Theresa and Denis; his sister Kristen and her husband Matt, and niece, Avery; as well as many other loving aunts, uncles, cousins, and countless friends. His legacy will live on through his children, his ministry, and the countless lives he touched with his compassion and truth. 

His life pointed toward a faithful God who meets us in our deepest need. The verse he kept close in the final season of his life was Psalm 146:2, 

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="https://www.esv.org/Psalm+146:2/" caption="Psalm 146:2">
    <div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">2.</span> I will praise the Lord all my life;</div>
        <div class="ml-6">I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.</div>
    </div>
</x-blockquote>

A viewing will be held on Tuesday, July 1, between 4-7pm at Doherty Funeral Home (456 High Street, Dedham, MA 02026). A celebration of Tim’s life will be held on Wednesday, July 2, at 10am at Bethel AME Church (40 Walk Hill Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130). Please park at 84 Wachusett Street, Jamaica Plain, MA 02130. In lieu of flowers, the family invites donations to be made to Inheritance of Hope, an organization which has served the Alberts over the past four years. IOH is dedicated to supporting families with a parent facing a terminal illness

Per Tim’s wishes I will continue to use this platform to provide hope and truth about God‘s good news. amidst some of our hardest times.

Thank you for all your support throughout this four year journey. Tim was grateful for each and every one of you. 

Jim
