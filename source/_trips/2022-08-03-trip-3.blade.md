On my way home from trip 3 and dose 6. I‚Äôm starting to get used to the rhythms of traveling overseas every 3 to 5 weeks - it feels like I was just here üá©üá™.  This time my good friend, Bryan, joined me. We had a lot of fun touring around London and Tubingen.

Sometime in the next few weeks I should find out my initial immune response to the vaccine and keytruda treatments. These results won‚Äôt tell the whole story, but it will be a significant milestone in this journey. 

If you pray, please pray for me, that the results would show my immune system responding as expected, but even more so that I ‚Äúwouldn‚Äôt fear bad news‚Äù (<a  class="text-yellow-500 hover:underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.esv.org/Psalm+112:1;Psalm+112:7/">Psalm 112:1, 7</a>).

It has been a great joy to go on this journey with so many of my closest friends and family. You have gone through the Valley with me and made it a "place of springs" (<a class="text-yellow-500 hover:underline underline-offset-4" href="https://www.esv.org/Psalm+84/">Psalm 84</a>).
