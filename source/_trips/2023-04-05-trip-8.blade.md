My cousin Jim packed this truth and accompanied me for my eighth successful trip.

I received the 11th dose of my vaccine and good news that immune testing shows incremental gains. For now, treatment will continue every 3 months and I'll find out additional immune results in a few weeks.

Lately, I've found myself worrying over things that are out of my control and that's been a recipe for anxiety.

Thankfully, this trip aligned to provide time and space to reflect on God’s tender, loving care in and through the uncertainty of my condition and the pressures of everyday life.

It was timely to prepare my heart for celebrating all that was accomplished in the life, death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ! We will enjoy some extra time with family celebrating Easter this weekend. If you are looking for a place to worship this year and are in the area of Hyde Park in Boston, please join us at our church, <a href="http://parkwaypresbyterian.com" class="text-yellow-500">Parkway Presbyterian</a>!

Thank you for your consistent support and care!
