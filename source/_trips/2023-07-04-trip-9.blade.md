Kate and I extended this 9th trip into a week-long adventure. After my 12th dose of the vaccine in Tubingen we were off to Madrid and then London.

 For a few days, we resided with Kate‚Äôs colleague Juan and his hospitable family. Blessed by an authentic experience of an ancient culture, we enjoyed touring Madrid, delicious food, and in the afternoons, a much needed siesta. I couldn‚Äôt have orchestrated such a pleasurable stay, but by God‚Äôs grace we were shown love through his people all over the world.

After Madrid we were off to London hoping to attend üéæ Wimbledon. Although I stumbled into _The All England Lawn Tennis Club_ last year, I was unaware of what the queue truly was. We approached the grounds and were shocked at the length of the entry line. It rained off and on, but it played to our advantage, cutting the wait in half allowing us to see some great tennis on court 1! On Sunday, it was a pleasant surprise to connect with our good friend Thaddeus at St Helen's Bishopsgate. After church, we took a walk around the city together before hitting Wimbledon for a second day.

Needless to say, coming home we are exhausted,  but energized to reunite with our boys. They‚Äôve been cared for and kept in-line by our families.


I‚Äôve thought about the love of God often described in the Bible like a father. The <a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.st-helens.org.uk/resources/talk/58259/video/">message on Sunday</a> pointed to God‚Äôs protective care for his ‚Äúlittle ones‚Äù (Matthew 18:7-14). It is an amazing grace that the father didn‚Äôt send his son to condemn, but to rescue. When I drift off feeling like a speck (<a class="text-yellow-500" href="https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-cosmos-keeps-preaching">which I am</a>), I‚Äôm renewed by what God‚Äôs done through Jesus Christ. I‚Äôve been rescued as a ‚Äúprecious  treasure.‚Äù
