My surgeon removed my right frontal lobe – who knew you could cut out a large part of your brain and wake up functioning well enough. Two weeks later I was able to dust off my shoes and celebrate the holiday having much to give thanks for.

Although surgery was a success, my pathology revealed aggressive cancer still lurks and repeating the “standard of care” would likely only buy a short amount of time before being back in a similar situation. Our prayers for results to show inflammation or the tumor to miraculously disappear seem unanswered. I’ve wondered if I can actually embody a life that is “sorrowful, yet always rejoicing” (2 Corinthians 6:10).
Sorrow comes easily fixating on the circumstances. Joy, however, has been hard to find through all my anticancer research. C.S. Lewis’ insight on the reorienting process of pain rings loud and clear.


<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="" caption="C.S. Lewis - The Problem of Pain">

        “God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world.”
    </div>
</x-blockquote>

Although the Lord has limited my abilities, he’s brought a greater focus on the things that are eternal: God himself, his word, and people made in his image. I’m grateful for the opportunity to slow down and reprioritize.

<h2>What's Next</h2>

While uncertainties remain, there’s been <a href="https://virtualtrials.org/newsarticle.cfm?item=8544">plenty to be hopeful</a> about from the medical world. In December, I began traveling to Northwell Health in Long Island once a month to start a <a href="https://www.alpheusmedical.com">novel, non-invasive clinical trial</a>.

In addition to enrolling in this clinical trial, I’ve been advised that, if at all possible, the optimal treatment remains immunotherapy through a revamped vaccine. As a result, and with encouragement from many, we’ve decided to reopen <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/Help-Tim-Fund-Vital-Brain-Cancer-Treatment">our GoFundMe</a> with a new target to offset the private costs (~$200,000) of this type of precision medicine not yet allowed to be administered in the United States. The goal is to start a new immunotherapy routine, Lord willing, by March after completing the 4 doses of the trial.

My body has been resilient the past few months and I've been able to return to normal activities. It was a joy to spend time with family over the holidays and keep busy volunteering my time in various capacities with <a href="provenanceprecisionmedicine.org">The Provenance Foundation</a>, <a href="https://www.patricesurley.com">Revitalized Health with Patrice</a> and <a href="https://drmaryjodimilia.com">Dr. Mary Jo Dimilla</a>.
