Merry Christmas from the Albert family!

We wish you peace and joy as we celebrate Christmas and anticipate the Lord Jesus’ coming again!

That hope feels fresh and powerful for us as last week, my MRI brought some challenging news:  My cancer is progressing and a change in treatment is necessary immediately.

Thankfully, we were able to pivot quickly but are in need of prayers of faith and God’s mercy for the treatments to slow and regress progress before more serious deficits emerg

I’m humbled by the community behind me this past year. Thank you for the consistent encouragement and generous support. The Lord has done far more abundantly than I could ask or even think!
<br>Tim, Kate, Caleb Nathan & Matthew
