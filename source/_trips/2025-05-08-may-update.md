Dear Family and Friends,

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your continued patience and support between updates.

At this stage, my health continues to decline, and after much prayer and reflection, we’ve made the decision to shift our focus fully to quality of life. That means stepping away from further chemotherapy. While the fight isn’t over, I wanted to share this update honestly, knowing how unpredictable things can become.

We’ve begun working with hospice care at home, which has been an incredible gift—not only for me, but for Kate and our family. Kate has also temporarily stepped away from her role at BTA so she can be here with us. I’m deeply grateful to her, and to BTA, for making that possible.

I can’t begin to express the depth of our gratitude for the love, prayers, generosity, and tangible acts of kindness you’ve shown us over the past four years. Time and again, you’ve reminded us that we’re not walking this road alone. Through you, we’ve experienced the hands and feet of God in action—and I’ve encountered His love in powerful new ways because of it. Thank you. Truly.

As I’ve shared before, Psalm 62 continues to be a wellspring of strength for me—and I hope it might be for you, too:

<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="https://www.esv.org/Psalm+62:5-8/" caption="Psalm 62:5-8">
    <div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">5.</span> For God alone, O my soul, wait in silence,</div>
        <div class="ml-6">for my hope is from him.</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">6.</span> He only is my rock and my salvation,
        <div class="ml-6">my fortress; I shall not be shaken.</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">7.</span> On God rests my salvation and my glory;</div>
        <div class="ml-6">my mighty rock, my refuge is God.</div>
        <div><span class="text-sm font-semibold">8.</span> Trust in him at all times, O people;
        <div class="ml-6">pour out your heart before him;</div>
        <div class="ml-6">God is a refuge for us. Selah</div>
    </div>
</x-blockquote>


I remain anchored in the truth that God is my rock and refuge. He is in control. He holds me—and He holds you. And even in the face of uncertainty, that gives me peace beyond understanding.

From here, Kate and my cousin Jim will provide any future updates as needed, while I focus on “Living for the Line” and being fully present with my family.

Thank you again for your prayers, your love, and all you’ve done—and continue to do—for me and those I love.

With deep love and heartfelt gratitude,

Tim

On behalf of the Albert Family
