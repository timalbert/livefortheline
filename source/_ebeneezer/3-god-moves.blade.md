<x-blockquote class="font-mono" cite="https://hymnary.org/text/god_moves_in_a_mysterious_way" caption="William Cowper | God Moves in a Mysterious Way">
    <p>God moves in a mysterious way, his wonders to perform; he plants his footsteps in the sea, and rides upon the storm.</p>
    <p>Deep in unfathomable mines, of never-failing skill; he fashions up his bright designs, and works his sovereign will.</p>
    <p>Ye fearful saints fresh courage take, the clouds that you much dread, are big with mercy and will break in blessings on your head.</p>
    <p>Judge not the Lord by feeble sense, but trust him for his grace; behind a frowning providence, he hides a smiling face.</p>
    <p>His purposes will ripen fast, unfolding every hour; the bud may have a bitter taste, but sweet will be the flower.</p>
    <p>Blind unbelief is sure to err, and scan his work in vain; God is his own interpreter, and he will make it plain.</p>
