Dr. Jones resected around 95% of the tumor during surgery. Originally, her goal was 80%. While this was not everything, it felt like a real victory. Only later would I find out how complex the surgery was and how masterful a job Dr. Jones was able to do. So many things could have gone wrong during my procedure. Even the slightest misstep could have caused irreversible damage to my brain affecting everything from speech, balance, eyesight and cognition. I’m grateful to walk away seemingly unscathed. 

Immediately I was put on some heavy medication including morphine for pain management and decadron for potential seizure activity, in addition to a cocktail of drugs to counteract nausea. 

After a few days recovering at MGH it was clear that I’d need rehab. It was really hard to walk in the days following surgery. I hardly moved from the bed. My routine was to get up every so often to sit in the chair 3 feet beside me. 

This was a lonely time. I can’t fully express how painful it was to be alone, without any prospects of a visitor. Not even my wife Kate or pastor Bryan could visit. I’m grateful for the grace of FaceTime and Zoom, but they fell far short from the comfort I needed in a time like this. You can’t embrace a screen with a hug, my young boys didn’t understand why they couldn’t see their dad. I’m afraid of the ripple effect from treating everyone like they have a disease, even under the circumstances of a pandemic. 

On the third day recovering at MGH a woman from our church, who happens to work at the hospital, heard I was admitted and came to visit. I was so thankful for some familiar company. She brought Valentine’s Day cards so I could write something to the boys and Kate and offered to deliver them! What an incredible gift this was to me!

## At last!

After 10 days, at last I was leaving this all behaving. Kate picked me up at Spaulding Rehab in Charlestown and we drove to my appointment at MGH with Dr. Miller, the oncologist who would be giving us the results from pathology. I’ll be honest, I wasn’t even sure what an oncologist was until a few days before this. It wasn’t until Eric, who is a pathologist himself, informed me of the weight of what I was stepping into a day or two before my appointment. 

## “Don’t Google it”

Dr. Miller informed me as gently as she could that the news was not what we were hoping for. I was diagnosed with a grade 4 astrocytoma and urged not to do my own research just yet as gliomas were being reclassified by the World Health Organization. It would be hard to find accurate information just searching around the internet. I can’t imagine being in an oncologist’s position. Having to deliver news to someone that they have a terminal illness is a pastoral job. No one should have to bear the responsibility to tell such shocking, life-altering news. The world is not as it should be. 

We were sent home reeling from  the diagnosis and the road that lies before us. I sat at home holding our one month old son, Matthew, waiting for Caleb and Nathan to get home from school. It was a moment of joy and grief to be with my family, at last! I think our young boys were most excited to finally celebrate Dad’s birthday and eat cake! My mom, dad and sister came to visit the next day. Kate had a friend fly in who was a tremendous blessing, helping with the boys and optimizing our small apartment. 

Despite this diagnosis, providence has marked so much of my story. If I hadn’t been urged to go to MEEI by my optometrist, who knows how my story unfolds. Being in the middle of a pandemic, it would have been easy to push off some mild symptoms. 

## “COVID be damned!"

A pastor friend of ours offered to come to the house for a short visit and to pray with us. We were excited to have a friend who has meant so much to us come for a visit. He listened, shared in our grief, and prayed over us and our kids. We sat across our sectional while he visited, but as our friend was getting ready to leave, he came over saying “COVID be damned” and gave me my first non-familial hug in months. I will never forget that moment and did not know how much I needed it. 

## In The Mud

I’ve been held up by so many this past year. In prayer, through practical and financial help. A few men from my church even organized rides for the duration of my 6 weeks of daily radiation. I’ve been taught a lesson in generosity through it all and have been humbled by those willing to walk through this mud with me. At times it felt more like an army crawl. My family, Kate and Pastor Bryan have been the most constant, daily encouragement. To have a wife who is not running, a pastor ready and willing to struggle and work through the hardest questions, and the unyielding support of family and friends has brought me to my knees in thankfulness. “I thank my God in all my remembrance of you” (Philippians 1:3). 

## Providence

I’ve been at some of my lowest moments this year. Depression set in almost immediately, I lost a significant amount of vision from the tumor and haven’t been willing or able  to drive since before the events of February 2021. 

In many ways our life has been inverted: I’m at home full-time, leaving my job at Northeastern and going on long-term disability. Kate took on a full-time role as the Athletics Director with the school she’s been working at for years. Adjusting to the new order of our lives has been hard, but also brought a lot of unexpected joys. I ‘be taken on new domestic responsibilities, planning and cooking most of the meals. Kate, in addition to her role as AD, coached the varsity lacrosse team in the spring. The Lord’s provision brought us to our first home in an ideal neighborhood of Boston, Hyde Park, where BTA is located, our church meets, and public transportation is accessible. After years of making offers, nearly moving out of state, and much disappointment, our townhome fits us perfectly, with plenty of space, a small yard, and a 5 minute walk to one of our kid’s favorite playgrounds. 

## Fighting Back

I remember talking to my Father-in-law from the hospital. I was worried about Kate, what she would do if I didn't make it. He encouraged me, “you don’t worry about that, you just need to fight.” Kate was already at work. She had found an article published in Nature, a prestigious medical journal, about a vaccine trial with very promising results. I didn’t know what I was looking at and wasn’t ready to dive in deep reading about patient journeys and what others have done to throw the kitchen sink at this. Sometime in the early spring of 2021 we connected with a dietitian who specialized in gliomas. She armed us with a nutrition plan and more research than we knew what to do with. She was adamant about looking into a clinic in Germany producing neoantigen peptide vaccines, personalized to the genetics of your tumor. “I think you’re an ideal candidate for this type of  treatment.” She warned us that it was expensive, not covered by insurance, and would require a year of travel, once per month for the administration of the vaccine in Tubingen, Germany. 

By March of 2022 we had all the confirmations we needed to feel confident that this personalized vaccine, though experimental, was a “no-brainer” for me. Over the course of 4 days, we raised well over our goal of $125,00 which would fully cover my treatment at CeGat including travel and lodging for the year. It was simply amazing to witness. So many onlookers shared in our joy as well over 600 people helped us surpass our ambitious goal.

Although I never wanted to be the face of a Gofundme campaign, God taught me a lesson in generosity. He truly “owns the cattle on a thousand hills” (Psalm 50:10).

## The valley is the place of vision

I’ve needed all the help I can get to worship God in this season. I’ve been learning to love the Psalms – especially Psalms 23, 34, 62, 84, 90, 145 and 147. They’ve given me a language to speak when often, I couldn't mutter a word on my own. A familiar puritan-type prayer has also held true for me called The Valley of Vision:

<x-blockquote>
    <div>Lord, High and Holy, Meek and Lowly,</div>

    <div class="mt-4">Thou hast brought me to the valley of vision,
    where I live in the depths but see thee in the heights;
    hemmed in by mountains of sin I behold thy glory.</div>

    <div class="mt-4">Let me learn by paradox
    that the way down is the way up,
    that to be low is to be high,
    that the broken heart is the healed heart,
    that the contrite spirit is the rejoicing spirit,
    that the repenting soul is the victorious soul,
    that to have nothing is to possess all,
    that to bear the cross is to wear the crown,
    that to give is to receive,
    that the valley is the place of vision.</div>

    <div class="mt-4">Lord, in the daytime stars can be seen from deepest wells,
    and the deeper the wells the brighter thy stars shine;</div>

    <div class="mt-4">Let me find thy light in my darkness,
    thy life in my death,
    thy joy in my sorrow,
    thy grace in my sin,
    thy riches in my poverty,
    thy glory in my valley.</div>
